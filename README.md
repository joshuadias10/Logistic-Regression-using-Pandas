# Logistic Regression using Pandas Library

This repository contains a Logistic Regression implementation using the pandas library for data handling and the `sklearn` library for classification. The dataset used is the breast cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

## Overview

- **Data Handling:** Utilizes pandas to load and preprocess the dataset.
- **Model:** Implements Logistic Regression using `sklearn`.
- **Evaluation:** Provides accuracy score and confusion matrix for model performance.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Uses pandas to convert the dataset into a DataFrame.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles feature and target separation.
- **Training and Prediction:** Trains a Logistic Regression model and makes predictions.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Computes accuracy and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Load and Prepare Data:** The code starts by loading the breast cancer dataset and converting it into a DataFrame.
2. **Preprocess Data:** Splits data into training and testing sets.
3. **Train Model:** Fits a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
4. **Evaluate Model:** Makes predictions on the test data and prints evaluation metrics.
